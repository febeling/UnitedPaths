*** TODO keep time of line intersection
*** TODO make iOS compatible (only CGPathRef?)
*** TODO Support Intersection
*** TODO Add tests where marked
*** TODO Add make hole into shape example to app

| or              | union                                             |
| not             | difference (relative complement)                  |
| xor             | symmetric difference (union without intersection) |
